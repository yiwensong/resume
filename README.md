## Projects
### [GPU Compression](https://github.com/yiwensong/lzss)

* Parallelized implementation of LZSS compression for the GPU with CUDA.
* The goal of the project was to test feasibility of using message compression in HPC applications.
* Result: your network needs to be *really* bad for this to be worth anything.

### [ImgCompress](https://github.com/yiwensong/imgcompress)

* ImgCompress is a hackathon project aimed at becoming the future of compression.
* Uploads binaries to Imgur as PNGs and stores the 7 character Imgur URL.
* Compression ratio is over 700 000 and implementation is less than 200 lines of python.
* Better than the CUDA stuff I made.

### [Poker AI](https://github.com/yiwensong/huplo)

* Heads Up Pot-Limit Omaha (HUPLO) AI that uses Monte Carlo search trees and bad machine learning.
* 💩 at poker.
* Passable at Tic-Tac-Toe.

### [Yet Another Personal Site | DefDontHire.Me](https://github.com/yiwensong/yiwensong.github.io)

* Technology has advanced to a point where you can create a beautiful website without knowing any web.
* Literally anyone can download a Bootstrap template and write some BS and call it a personal site.
* [Exhibit A](http://yiwensong.com)

### [yiwen.date](https://github.com/yiwensong/yiwen.date)

* Another personal site, but maybe a little more personal.
* Frontend written in React, backend written with Flask.
