## Projects
### [GPU Compression](https://github.com/yiwensong/lzss)

* Parallelized implementation of LZSS compression for the GPU with CUDA.
* The goal of the project was to test feasibility of using message compression in HPC applications.
* Result: your network needs to be *really* bad for this to be worth anything.

### [ImgCompress](https://github.com/yiwensong/imgcompress)

* ImgCompress is a hackathon project aimed at becoming the future of compression.
* Uploads binaries to Imgur as PNGs and stores the 7 character Imgur URL.
* Compression ratio is over 700 000 and implementation is less than 200 lines of python.
* Better than the CUDA stuff I made.

### [Poker AI](https://github.com/yiwensong/huplo)

* Heads Up Pot-Limit Omaha (HUPLO) AI that uses Monte Carlo search trees and bad machine learning.
* ðŸ’© at poker.
